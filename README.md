# Pokemon-Card-Info-Scraper

A small project for a friend who wanted to collate data from https://pkmncards.com/sets/
The project uses https://html-agility-pack.net to retrieve the website data and manipulate how I need

This project probably did not need to be done in ASP.NET MVC - the tutorial I briefly followed used it but I did not get to the point in the tutorial that actually utilised it.
None the less this was good practice to work in just C# without usually using Unity.

I tried my best to make the code clean and readable as well as avoiding spaghetti code. All the code can be found in the HomeController.cs - which probably should be moved into
it's own script
